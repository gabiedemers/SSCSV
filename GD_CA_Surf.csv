When it's on, it's ON.  It can be very challenging and so to a great extent it polices itself.  There are two other breaks very closely associated with it and there is a long running fairly insular crew that have been surfing it regularly for at least as long as I have.  It produces waves year round, although the quantity and quality decline severely during the off season and it can be too big to handle during much of the winter, so it requires a great deal of investment in time and gas to monitor it and make sure it's taken advantage of when conditions are optimal.  To be fully capitalized on requires a great deal of skill and dedication.  Occasionally newcommers possess the skill and tact to integrate quickly but more generally it takes up to several years.  Despite a regular influx of newcomers every year due to the nearby university, there are not often fights or negative attitudes associated with the spot because, as I said, it tends to police itself.  If you don't belong there the spot will generally inform you so it's not usually necessary for a human to intervene.  That said, the locals do command respect and they generally get it.",Yes,"Only a couple of times has there been polluted water sufficient to keep me away and that's been a long time since.  At least a few times a year there are great white shark sightings and occassional injurious shark encounters and since I have a family I will usually stay away that day or maybe even for a couple days.  The spot is accessed via BLM land so it was gated off during the big federal government shut down last year.  Surfers were still al2ed to walk in but it is a substantial hike and in fact a shark attack occurred there during that time so that there were no vehicles on the beach and it took nearly 40 minutes to get an ambulance to the victim.  I chose to stay away from there until the gate was re-opened, which was several weeks.","Take away the North Jetty and you may as well take away surfing because there's no other spot within striking distance that is going to be accessible enough and productive enough to keep me suiting up several times a week, week after week, year after year.  Again, it's my home break.","It would be devestating.  I literally use the moniker ""Jetty Rat"" on several internet forums that have nothing to do with surfing.  As I said it's only one of two spots I consider my ""home break"" but it's the closest, most accessible, and most productive of those two spots, and it's definitely where I learned to go big.  Even on the rare occassions when I've travelled to warm waters with 6 quality surf, given the challenges of unfamiliar and sometimes unfriendly crowds, I always long for my home break.  My other ""home break"" is Camel Rock, about 20 miles to the north, and it only breaks at all under certain conditions, usually only for a couple hours at a time and only during about a third of the year.  I love that spot equally but it's just not as big a part of my life and the Harbor Entrance to the North Jetty actually offers an alternative that is available usually during the same conditions as Camel Rock.  The Harbor Entrance and the North Jetty are two distinct spots but they are right next to each other and are both possible only because of the geography that makes up the mouth of Humboldt Bay.",40.80039978,-124.1528015,2,Humboldt,Eureka,Eureka (City of),6,40.7681,-124.2312,Humboldt Bay - North Jetty,North Jetty,5,,,

For most long time residents, Silver Strand is both a physical place and a state of mind. It is located in Oxnard, which despite its location on the southern California coast just south of places like Santa Barbara and Ventura, and just north of Malibu (which all possess way more surfers and surf culture than Oxnard), is much more ""urban-minded"" thanks to its demographics. Silver Strand is on the edge of town, on the edge of the continent, at the end of an ""only-one-way-in-only-one-way-out"" road. As such, it has long been a magnet for divergent thinkers, weirdos, and a tight-knit tribe of hard core surfers. In the 1980s and 1990s when I was a child, its localism was so notorious that few outsiders ever ventured in. Thanks to Dane, Nick Rosza, and the dozens of other pros who have filmed clips there during our prime wave season and posted them online for all to see, people now know there is perhaps California's best, punchiest beach break. All respect to Black's down in San Diego, but we've got our own submarine canyon funneling peaky tubes in ALL winter, and thanks to the nasty localism rep, it's often still just ""the boys"" out there on the best days. I surfed Black's plenty, but it's a joke how crowded it is and how unskilled the surfers in the lineup are out there. That shit doesn't fly on the peak at Strand, on good days or shitty days. But times have changed in terms of managing the visitors who come to score, most notably over the last 3 years. I've seen things these last three years that simply COULD NOT have happened when I was younger due to violence and property damage. Things like strangers parking fancy cars full of friends and boards without fear, then paddling out en masse with go Pros to go show their girlfriends or mamas at home how swell they did out at ""the Strand"" that day. Things like Timmy Patterson boards, manufactured in San Clemente. That was a guaranteed ass-whipping when I was younger, usually administered by ""the uncles.""  I do not miss the violence and subsequent police harassment of surfers from Strand, I do not miss being classified as a ""documented gang member"" because I have a Silver Strand Locals (SSL) tatoo, I do not miss the aggression shown towards any vehicle entering the beach (remember: one way in and out, small town, everybody knows everybody else, and if they don't know you, they stare daggers) that is not endemic to the beach. But I do miss surfing on Saturday mornings with just my neighbors and friends, riding boards made by other neighbors and friends, spending time in the water at the place each of us has literally built our lives around, without the frenzy of 500 other guys pulling up from some point inland and paddling out like they own it. I liken it to me (a 33 year-old white guy with average skills) just pulling up at some basketball court in Watts on a Saturday morning, and expecting to get in the game. That ain't happening! Anyway, sorry to ramble, but that's why I love Silver Strand. We all do!",No,,"Yes. That's a bit like asking a fish, ""Would your life be impacted if you could never swim in water again?""","Profound sadness, and perhaps enthusiastic to find another hidden gem of a community and a wave.  surfing is my life, and I've been around the world, but Silver Strand is my home chapel. It's where I learned to worship. ",34.25010681,-119.1607971,12,Ventura,Oxnard,Oxnard (City of),40,34.1553,,Silver Strand,Oxnard,100,,,

Changes a lot.  Can hold big long period swell.  When the swell period is longer then 22-24 seconds, there aren't a lot of socal places that can actually make the most of the swell, but c-street really comes alive.  Once in awhile, it is really really good and one of the longest awesomest points I've seen, but that is very rare.  Most of my life, I've ridden heavy slab reefbreaks on a bodyboard, but I learned to surf (longboard/shortboard) at c-street, so even when its small, I've had a lot of fun there.  So its kind of pretty good for everything...I even bodysurf there under certain conditions.  You never know what you will get.  So its super fun in a lot of different waves depending on the swell, sometimes barreling, sometimes a long slow big point break, sometimes 2ft longboard waves.  However, its not exactly a life changing wave, which is why I didn't rate it 6er.  Its not one of those waves that you ride for one day and it changes who you are, at least not for me, its a more subtle fun enjoyable wave.",No,,"Ok just because I know this wave the best doesn't mean its my favorite.  I move a lot so it is the spot I lived close to for the longest.  So yeah, it would be impacted, but right now I live 3000 miles away and its okay...there are a lot of epic waves all over the world.  C-street is like a fun terrain park kind of.  So I guess yeah my life is impacted by it in that I can't ride that particular wave anymore, and it does mean a lot to me, but I am okay with that.  I do miss the spot though.   There is a richness of culture, friends, all different kinds of waves on different days, and a refuge from regular life there.  It's also just beautiful, and I think people need beautiful places.  ","It would feel like I couldn't see an old friend.  We have lots of memories together and always will, but its better to actually go there and say hi.  Now, if the wave were actually destroyed due to development or something, I would be incredibly angry.  That wave means a lot to a lot of people and myself and its a beautiful, wonderful place.  The only reason I didn't rate it 6er is because I am comparing it to one or two other waves (one in particular), that literally changed my life 100%.  So if I took those one or two waves out of the picture, it would get very 7 ratings.  So hopefully c-street will remain surfable and open to surfers for as long as the wave naturally exists.  But if I could never surf it again just because my life took me to a new place but c-street was still available for other surfers, well, it would be sad, but as Raimana van bastelaer said: ""If you’re connected with the right spirits, you don’t need to chase after the wave. If you are patient, the perfect wave will come to you.""  Which I 100% believe.  So its okay if I can't be at one spot.  There are waves beyond my imagination out there and I've ridden them, so who knows what else is in store if I can't ride c-street.  But it definitely, absolutely should stay protected for other people and in no way should ever be destroyed by people.  That would be nearly unforgivable.  It changes local kids' lives.  And gives local people something amazing in their lives every single day.  And it is essentially the center for Ventura surf culture, which is significant and important and really cool, a place where lots of shapers live and make a living and and surfers can find a community they belong in.",42.96609497,-70.98809814,12,Ventura,Ventura,San Buenaventura (City of),39,34.27247,-119.29942,C Street,C Street (same as Ventura Point),98,,,

Management of Lighthouse Field park and parking lots by the city has been turned over to State Parks (property owner) which does not open the lots until well after sunrise (sometimes 9am) forcing early morning surfers to park in the surrounding residential neighborhoods. ","yes. as noted earler, proximity to the Lane al2s me to surf on a weekly if not daily basis during the surf season. If the Lane were lost, many thousands of surfer would be displaced. It is the only westside surf spot that isn't truly 2-tide dependent. Surfers would have to frequent other wind-protected ""town"" locations in Pleasure Point which are already extremely impacted (ie, crowded). Losing the Lane would be a tragedy for the entire SC surfing community. This is not an overstatement. ","Although I have many ""favorite"" town and north spots that I love to surf, I live to surf the Lane. Ten-foot west swell at Middle Peak and Indicators is life confirming.
